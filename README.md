# ❤️ Positive Mixed Messages 
## About the project
In this project I'm tasked to build a node.js console app that generates random messages each time a user runs the program. I plan to take this a step further and build a User Interface for the front end which allows a user to click a button to generate a positive message. This is an opportunity for me to experiment with my current knowledge in JavaScript while also using Git/Github for version control. Lastly users will be able to run the script in the console, where positive mixed messages can still generate each time a user runs the program.
